	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of big data analytics (BDA) in human resource management (HRM). The emergence of digital technology and the availability of large volume, high velocity and a great variety of data has forced the HRM to adopt the BDA in managing the workforce. Design/methodology/approach: This paper evaluates the past, present and future trends of HRM through the bibliometric analysis of citation, co-citation and co-word analysis. Findings: Findings from the analysis present significant research clusters that imply the knowledge structure and mapping of research streams in HRM. Challenges in BDA application and firm performances appear in all three bibliometric analyses, indicating this subject’s past, current and future trends in HRM. Practical implications: Implications on the HRM landscape include fostering a data-driven culture in the workplace to reap the potential benefits of BDA. Firms must strategically adapt BDA as a change management initiative to transform the traditional way of managing the workforce toward adapting BDA as analytical tool in HRM decision-making. Originality/value: This study presents past, present and future trends in BDA knowledge structure in human resources management. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This work aims to improve two of the five Vs of the big data system. We used the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for the review. We analyzed the research papers published over the last 10 years about the topic in question using a keyword-based search and bibliometric analysis. The systematic literature review was conducted in multiple phases, and filters were applied to exclude papers based on the title and abstract initially, then based on the methodology/conclusion, and, finally, after reading the full text. The remaining papers were then considered and are discussed here. We found that automated data discovery methods can be augmented by applying an NLP-based thematic analysis on the financial data in cloud environments. This can help identify the correct classification/categorization and measure data quality for a sentiment analysis. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {There have recently been intensive efforts aimed at addressing the challenges of environmental degradation and climate change through the applied innovative solutions of AI, IoT, and Big Data. Given the synergistic potential of these advanced technologies, their convergence is being embraced and leveraged by smart cities in an attempt to make progress toward reaching the environmental targets of sustainable development goals under what has been termed “environmentally sustainable smart cities.” This new paradigm of urbanism represents a significant research gap in and of itself. To fill this gap, this study explores the key research trends and driving factors of environmentally sustainable smart cities and maps their thematic evolution. Further, it examines the fragmentation, amalgamation, and transition of their underlying models of urbanism as well as their converging AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies and solutions. It employs and combines bibliometric analysis and evidence synthesis methods. A total of 2,574 documents were collected from the Web of Science database and compartmentalized into three sub-periods: 1991–2015, 2016–2019, and 2020–2021. The results show that environmentally sustainable smart cities are a rapidly growing trend that markedly escalated during the second and third periods—due to the acceleration of the digitalization and decarbonization agendas—thanks to COVID-19 and the rapid advancement of data-driven technologies. The analysis also reveals that, while the overall priority research topics have been dynamic over time—some AI models and techniques and environmental sustainability areas have received more attention than others. The evidence synthesized indicates that the increasing criticism of the fragmentation of smart cities and sustainable cities, the widespread diffusion of the SDGs agenda, and the dominance of advanced ICT have significantly impacted the materialization of environmentally sustainable smart cities, thereby influencing the landscape and dynamics of smart cities. It also suggests that the convergence of AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies provides new approaches to tackling the challenges of environmental sustainability. However, these technologies involve environmental costs and pose ethical risks and regulatory conundrums. The findings can inform scholars and practitioners of the emerging data-driven technology solutions of smart cities, as well as assist policymakers in designing and implementing responsive environmental policies. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the increasing problems of environmental pollution and energy security, energy-saving emission reduction and green low-carbon have become the focus of public opinion. Meanwhile, the New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) industry is beginning to rise gradually. Although NEV technology has made significant progress in some key technologies in China, there are still some technical bottlenecks restricting the popularization of NEVs. In order to understand the research hotspots and trends in the technology area of NEV quickly, objectively and intuitively, this paper studies the published literature on technical direction of NEVS in CNKI Database for the past ten years, which is from 2011 to 2020. According to the method of keyword analysis of the bibliometric, all the keywords in the literature are statistically classified as the research object, research method and research hotspot. Therefore, considering the development and the bottleneck of the NEVs industry in China, this paper sums up the hotspots and difficult points on technical problems of NEVs in China for the past ten years, and then establishes the problem method database of the NEV technology in China. It could provide a basis for the development of the NEV technology disciplines, and then contribute to facilitating the solution of the core technology in the field of NEVs. With the advent of intelligent and networked vehicles, artificial intelligence algorithm is applied to the energy management and control system of energy vehicles, so as to make common progress in the industrial production technology of new energy vehicles and artificial intelligence production technology. Big data has brought new challenges and opportunities to automobile Internet marketing. Using the big data system, Internet companies can accurately lock users, timely formulate and adjust refined marketing strategies according to the in-depth mining of big data, and timely quantitatively evaluate each effect. Big data provides technical basic support for Internet precision marketing in the automotive industry. With the big data system, brand marketing and effect marketing can be more accurate, and the tracking of effects can be more specific, so as to greatly reduce cost waste and improve user conversion rate. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

An increasingly important technology i.e., Big Data Analytics (BDA) can significantly benefit sustainable tourism regarding tourist destination selection, enhanced tourism experiences, and satisfaction. In this regard, the authors reviewed the extensive literature on BDA in sustainable tourism, traced the evolving trends, characterized the gaps, and provided recommendations for future research. The authors shortlisted 187 articles for in-depth analyses. A comprehensive literature review was developed, and a bibliometric study and network analyses were performed to analyse the extent and nature of BDA usage in the sustainable tourism area. The bibliometric study and network analyses helped the authors document the evolution and trends in applying BDA in sustainable tourism. Based on the literature review, a future research framework was developed by integrating BDA in sustainable tourism. The framework helped in envisioning relevant directions for future research. The article helps tourists, the tourism industry, the travel industry, and the hotel and hospitality service providers to gain insights into the benefits of using BDA in sustainable tourism and adopt BDA concepts and tools in tourism to help ensure improved tourist satisfaction. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {We present a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles, empirical as well as conceptual, investigating the integration of big data analytics in e-governance within business management, decision sciences, social sciences, and policy literature. Our primary objective in undertaking this review is to better understand the competing and conflicting scholarly perspectives on the integration of big data analytics in the delivery of governance, public services, and evidence-based policymaking. We focus particularly on a critical assessment of the literature to identify visible as well as less perceptible gaps in extant research to set a comprehensive future research agenda. In addition, we also aim to dig deeper into the landscape of the available research in terms of the volume of scientific production and other bibliometric characteristics to gauge the extent and nature of scholarly engagement with the area to inform future research. To these ends, we executed our systematic review through a four-step process of scoping, specification and execution of search protocols, short-listing of congruent literature, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis. In all, we identified 45 articles that attended to big data analytics and e-governance as the core concerns or themes. Our analysis generated four pillars on which the academic contributions in the area rest: actors, opportunities, tensions, and applications. We critically synthesized the findings around these four pillars to map the gaps and develop potential research questions that future researchers can address to expand the evidence and insights in the area to influence policy and governance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {At present, the information technology service industry is showing a good development trend. The rapid development of information technology has a significant impact on various fields. Driven by information technology, vocational training and education also enjoy the dividend brought by the development of information technology. In this context, vocational training provides more workers with endless opportunities, promotes the development of the labor market, and brings help to the wage problem of young people, especially some children. At the same time, vocational training is closely related to employment and education, which has brought certain changes to the youth and the labor market. Moreover, the state's attention to vocational training is also increasing, and vocational training is of great significance to the transformation of employment and education. However, there is a gap in the bibliometric analysis of this topic. Based on 694 articles retrieved from the web of science database from 1950 to 2020, this paper mainly reviews the highly cited literature on 'vocational training', 'employment', 'education', 'Youth', 'labor market'. By using big data analysis technology and visualization software, the author's key points such as keywords, main research institutions, countries, and publication sources are analyzed in detail. This paper makes a contribution to the literature of vocational training, employment, and education from the perspective of scientific measurement, to understand the impact of vocational training, education, and employment on youth and the labor market.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The results showed that remarkable achievements have been made in the application of food big data technology in the field of food safety management, which has provided a strong boost for full-chain food safety information monitoring, risk early warning, quality traceability, and so on. The application of the technology is faced with great difficulties and obstacles in the field of intelligent food manufacturing, but it shows great potential in 3D printed food research. The application in the field of dietary nutrition and health has slowly progressed and is currently still at a low level and far away from the realization of intelligent nutrition management and health intervention.While Chinese researchers have published a large number of papers concerning food big data technology, China still lags behind developed European and American countries in academic influence and cooperative relationship network.Therefore, it is urgent for the country to strengthen efforts to independently develop key technologies, as well as domestic and international cooperation and exchanges, so as to lay the foundation for the digital great-leap-forward development of China's food industry. © 2021, China Food Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Organizations may examine both past and present data with the aid of information management, giving them access to all the knowledge they need to make sound strategic choices. For the majority of contemporary enterprises, using data to make relevant, valid, and timely choices has become a must for success. The volume and format of data have changed significantly over the past few years as a result of the development of new technologies and applications, but there are also impressive possibilities for their analysis and processing. This study offers a bibliometric analysis of 650 publications written by 1977 academics on the use of information management and big data analytics. The Bibliometrix function in the R package and VOSviewer program were used to obtain the bibliographic data from the Scopus database and to analyze it. Based on citation analysis criteria, the top research journals, authors, and organizations were identified. The cooperation network at the author level reveals the connections between academics throughout the world, and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) identifies the research holes in the area. The recommendations for further study are influenced by the findings. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {When any kind of disaster occurs, victims who are directly and indirectly affected by the disaster often post vast amount of data (e.g., images, text, speech, video) using numerous social media platforms. This is because social media has recently become a primary communication channel among people to report either to public or to emergency responders (ERs). ERs, who are from various emergency response organizations (EROs), usually consider to gain awareness of the situation in order to respond to occurred disaster. However, with the occurrence of the disaster, within minutes, the social media platforms are flooded with various kinds of data which become overwhelmed for ERs with big data. Further, in this posted data, there may be majority of the data consist of redundant and irrelevant content. With this, it becomes challenging for ERs to make sense and take decisions of/on the available big data. Despite recent advances in the technology, processing and analyzing of the disaster related social media big data remains a challenging task. Hence, in this paper, we focus on presenting an initial analysis of a systematic literature review on application of artificial intelligence to analyze/process social media big data for efficient disaster management. During a systematic review process 68 publications were identified. Thereafter, we analyzed all the identified papers. From our analysis, we conclude that the most of the reviewed papers are on text and image classification and mostly convolutional neural networks have been employed for the classification. © 2018 IEEE.},

As a result, the research presented here is based on an analysis of scientific mapping on the level of business digital maturity and aims to identify the status of scientific articles indexed in the SCOPUS database. The SCOPUS database search strategy was developed based on the business digital maturity level, as well as the number of indexed articles, authors, thematic areas, types of documents, scientific areas, and keywords. The methodology used is descriptive-analytical, based on a deductive-inductive method in which specific parameters were excluded from the total results obtained and, in this way, working with documents that contribute significantly to the investigation was used for the years 2018 to 2022; two types of bibliometrics, co-presence and co-authorship, were used via the VoSViewer software and the Lens.org platform; and the search keywords were business, digital maturity, and industry 4.0. As a result, the clusters formed by co-authorships and keywords are displayed, as well as the types of documents and countries that have contributed the most to the scientific mapping investigation are also displayed. Finally, this type of research allows for the development of a technology-mediated systematic review that shows the increase in publications over the course of the study.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the recently published literature on the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) and integrate the insights it articulates on big data management algorithms, deep learning-based object detection technologies, and geospatial simulation and sensor fusion tools. The research problems were whether computer vision techniques, geospatial data mining, simulation-based digital twins, and real-time monitoring technology optimize remote sensing robots. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were leveraged by a Shiny app to obtain the flow diagram comprising evidence-based collected and managed data (the search results and screening procedures). Throughout January and July 2022, a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases was performed, with search terms comprising “Internet of Robotic Things” + “big data management algorithms”, “deep learning-based object detection technologies”, and “geospatial simulation and sensor fusion tools”. As the analyzed research was published between 2017 and 2022, only 379 sources fulfilled the eligibility standards. A total of 105, chiefly empirical, sources have been selected after removing full-text papers that were out of scope, did not have sufficient details, or had limited rigor For screening and quality evaluation so as to attain sound outcomes and correlations, we deployed AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews), AXIS (Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies), MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool), and ROBIS (to assess bias risk in systematic reviews). Dimensions was leveraged as regards initial bibliometric mapping (data visualization) and VOSviewer was harnessed in terms of layout algorithms. © 2023 by the authors.},

The outputs were analyzed using bibliometric techniques, network analysis and topic modeling. Findings: The number of scientific outputs in research with hospitality and tourism settings has been expanding over the period 2015–2020, with a substantial stability of the areas examined. The vast majority are published in academic journals where the main reference area is neither hospitality nor tourism. The body of research is rather fragmented and studies on relevant aspects, such as BD analytics capabilities, are virtually missing. Most of the outputs are empirical. Moreover, many of the articles collected relatively small quantities of records and, regardless of the time period considered, only a handful of articles mix a number of different techniques. Originality/value: This work sheds new light on the emergence of a body of research at the intersection of hospitality and tourism management and data science.

The digital government reform and construction of Guangdong Province also promotes the deep integration of government affairs openness and government services. However, for people from overseas, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and foreign nationals or enterprises, there is no perfect service system and mechanism, which undoubtedly becomes one of the obstacles to the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and is not conducive to the efficient development of the Greater Bay Area. At present, there is a gap in the bibliometric analysis of this topic. In this paper, 908 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science database, and the cited literatures on “e-government”, “management”, “social Science”, “business economy”, “Science and technology” were reviewed. With the use of big data analysis technology and visualization software, the author’s key words, major research institutions, countries and sources of publications are analyzed in detail, revealing the current situation related to the work of government affairs openness, so as to provide a more complete picture.

	abstract = {Big data analytics, described as the fourth paradigm of science breaking through Industry 4.0 technological development, continues to expand globally as organizations strive to attain the utmost value and sustainable competitive edge. Yet, concerning its contribution to developing sustainable products, there is a need for innovative research due to limited knowledge and uncertainty. This research is hence aimed at addressing (a) how research on big data analytics for sustainable products has evolved in recent years, and (b) how and in what terms it can contribute to developing sustainable products. To do so, this study includes a bibliometric review performed to shed light on the phenomenon gaining prominence. Next, the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, along with a survey, is used to analyze the matter in terms of the respective indicator set. The review’s findings revealed that there has been growing global research interest in the topic in the literature since its inception, and by advancing knowledge in the area, progress toward sustainable development goals 7, 8, 9, 12, and 17 can be made. The fuzzy-based analytical findings demonstrated that ‘product end-of-life management efficiency’ has the highest contributory coefficient of 0.787, followed by ‘product quality and durability’ and ‘functional performance’, with coefficients of 0.579 and 0.523, respectively. Such research, which is crucial for sustainable development, offers valuable insights to stakeholders seeking a deeper understanding of big data analytics and its contribution to developing sustainable products. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Academicians and practitioners have recently begun to accord Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) significant consideration when exploring emerging research trends in different fields. The technique of bibliometric review has been extensively applied to the AI and BDA literature to map out existing scholarships. We summarise 711 bibliometric articles on AI & its sub-sets and BDA published in multiple fields to identify academic disciplines with significant research contributions. We pulled bibliometric review papers from the Scopus Q1 and Q2 journal database published between 2012 and 2022. The Scopus database returned 711 documents published in journals of different disciplines from 59 countries, averaging 17.9 citations per year. Multiple software and Database Analysers were used to investigate the data and illustrate the most active scientific bibliometric indicators such as authors and co-authors, citations, co-citations, countries, institutions, journal sources, and subject areas. The USA was the most influential nation (101 documents; 5405 citations), while China was the most productive nation (204 documents; 2371 citations). The most productive institution was Symbiosis International University, India (32 documents; 4.5%). The results reveal a substantial increase in bibliometric reviews in five clusters of disciplines: (a) Business & Management, (b) Engineering and Construction, (c) Healthcare, (d) Sustainable Operations & I4.0, and (e) Tourism and Hospitality Studies, the majority of which investigate the applications and use cases of AI and BDA to address real-world problems in the field. The keyword co-occurrence in the past bibliometric analyses indicates that BDA, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Fuzzy Logic, and Expert Systems will remain conspicuous research areas in these five diverse clusters of domain areas. Therefore, this paper summarises the bibliometric reviews on AI and BDA in the fields of Business, Engineering, Healthcare, Sustainable Operations, and Hospitality Tourism and serves as a starting point for novice and experienced researchers interested in these topics. © 2023 by the authors.},

Digitalisation has allowed users to interact on social networks through platforms like Twitter, collecting user interactions over time, resulting in the proliferation of fake news. This research aims to analyse, evaluate and classify the predictive potential of Twitter analytics in healthcare, identifying the latent knowledge insights and distinguishing them from related rumours and fake news. Thus, a systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out to identify and analyse the existing academic research and applications in Twitter in predicting healthcare. The most important predictive applications are detecting mental health issues and public health emergencies. Covid-19 has been the main topic of most of the studies linked to fake news and misinformation, and this research provides a practical contribution to the use of unstructured data from Twitter and raises awareness of the importance of this content applied to healthcare. Therefore, it is pertinent to focus on the advances offered by these data as a predictive tool in healthcare since it is essential, to this end, to evaluate the veracity of the information shared on Twitter. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Big data can add value to organisations if processed, analysed and presented correctly. Organisations can benefit significantly from big data analytics if they have the capability to uncover hidden information from fully automated decision-making process. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of big data analytics to replace managerial decision-making. A systematic literature review approach is used to review relevant studies that are validated through qualitative data analysis. The potential to replace managerial decision-making with fully automated data driven decisions varies per problem domain. There is evidence that managerial, operational and tactical decision-making can be replaced by big data analytics for stable conditions using structured data. From the study, European countries are the ones benefiting highly from tactical and operational decisions without managerial control. Decision-makers should, therefore, re-evaluate strategic decisions resulting from automated processing from unstable conditions for high quality decisions and prevention of errors. Finding from an African context were based on case studies from Egypt, Morocco and South Africa. The case study from Egypt used an experimental case on retail sector with proven decisions effectiveness. © 2021 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.},

	abstract = {Incorporating big data analytics into a particular context brings various challenges that rest on the model or framework through which individuals or organisations adopt big data to achieve their objectives. Although these models have recently triggered scholars’ attention in various domains, in-depth knowledge of using each of these models in big data research is still blurred. This study enriches our knowledge on emerging models and theories that shape big data analytics adoption (BDAD) research through a bibliometric analysis of 229 studies (143 journal articles and 86 conference papers) published in indexed sources between 2013 and 2019. As a result, twenty models on BDAD have emerged (e.g., “Dynamic Capabilities”, “Resource-Based View”, “Technology Acceptance Model”, “Diffusion of Innovation”, etc.). The analysis reveals that BDAD research to demonstrate attributes suggestive of a topic at an initial stage of development as it is broadly dispersed across different domains employs a wide range of models, some of which overlap. Most of the applied models are generic in nature focusing on variance-based relationships and snapshot prediction with little consensus. There is a conspicuous dearth of process models, firm-level analysis and cultural orientation in contemporary BDAD research. Insights of this bibliometric study could guide rigorous big data research and practice in various contexts. The study concludes with research implications and limitations that offer promising prospects for forthcoming research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Eventually, the prediction model of author collaboration in bioinformatics research was developed using the abovementioned tools and expert-assigned weights. The calculations and data analysis were carried out using Expert Choice, Excel, Spark, and Scala, and Python programming languages in a big data server. Accordingly, the research was conducted in three phases: 1) identifying and weighting the factors contributing to authors' similarity measurement; 2) implementing co-authorship prediction model; and 3) integrating the first and second phases (i.e., integrating the weights obtained in the previous phases). The results showed that journal title, citation, article title, author affiliation, keywords, and abstract scored 0.374, 0.374, 0.091, 0.075, 0.055, and 0.031. Moreover, the journal title achieved the highest score in the model for the co-author recommender system. As the data in bibliometric information networks is static, it was proved remarkably effective to use content-based features for similarity measures. So that the recommender system can offer the most suitable collaboration suggestions. It is expected that the model works efficiently in other databases and provides suitable recommendations for author collaborations in other subject areas. By integrating expert opinion and systemic weights, the model can help alleviate the current information overload and facilitate collaborator lookup by authors. © 2021, International Journal of Information Science and Management, All Rights Reserved.},

To gain insights on the current research trends on machine learning for big data analytics, this study follows a bibliometric analysis methodology of citation data to review and quantitatively assess the explosion and impact of literature and research performance in this vibrant research area, which has witnessed rapid changes and rising interest in business, industry and academia. Using a variety of bibliometric measures and visualisation techniques, the paper examines and identifies several related issues including research productivity and directions, major contributors, publication trends and growth rates, citation and collaboration analysis, and others. The relevant bibliographic units for the study were collected from the Core Collection of the Web of Science bibliographic database. Nearly all the relevant publications prior to February 2018 were included in the analysis. The overwhelming productivity and wide-spread applications in several multidisciplinary domains have been revealed, with one-to-two ratio of journal to conference publications.

However, there is confusion in scientific discourse regarding the systemization of big data technologies which exacerbates this problem. Therefore, in this paper, a structured literature review is conducted to assess the current state of the art and give an overview about big data technology classifications. It can be stated that only very limited approaches for classifications exist, which are partially incomplete or address only single aspects of big data technologies, such as the used database type. Conducting this literature review, investigations have also been made to derive possible starting points for extending existing or developing new classification approaches, which can form the basis of a future big data classification framework. Such a concept could be used to improve the decision-support for planning and managing big data projects. However, a common understanding would require unambiguous definitions of the term technology and various other expressions, which are used in the literature as a synonym today. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Online Social Media (OSM) like Facebook and Twitter has emerged as a powerful tool to express via text people’s opinions and feelings about the current surrounding events. Understanding the emotions at the fine‐grained level of these expressed thoughts is important for system im-provement. Such crucial insights cannot be completely obtained by doing AI‐based big data sentiment analysis; hence, text‐based emotion detection using AI in social media big data has become an upcoming area of Natural Language Processing research. It can be used in various fields such as understanding expressed emotions, human–computer interaction, data mining, online education, recommendation systems, and psychology. Even though the research work is ongoing in this do-main, it still lacks a formal study that can give a qualitative (techniques used) and quantitative (con-tributions) literature overview. This study has considered 827 Scopus and 83 Web of Science research papers from the years 2005–2020 for the analysis. The qualitative review represents different emotion models, datasets, algorithms, and application domains of text‐based emotion detection. The quantitative bibliometric review of contributions presents research details such as publications, volume, co‐authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. In the end, challenges and probable solutions are showcased, which can provide future research directions in this area. © 2021 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The outburst growth of technology in the academic environment and the widespread use of digital libraries have generated big scholarly data. Ranking and measuring the impact of academic papers grants higher importance to the academic environment that is required for promotions, hiring, awards, grants, scholarships, and ranking university procedures. Google Scholar ranking depends mainly on the citation count of academic papers; therefore, some papers are ranked low even if they are qualified papers. Identifying the most important articles in the field is considered a critical issue for researchers, journals, and academic institutions. The goal of this study is to create a ranking system for big scholarly data (RBSD) that integrates network analysis based on graph analytics, citation analysis, and similarity between papers. The proposed model ranks papers based on the paper citation network to get the central papers. It also ranks authors to identify the top authors in the computer science citation network and analyzes the similarity between academic papers to get the relevancy between papers. A new methodology is proposed to rank papers based on a weighted score that considers paper information, author information, and publication venue information. The proposed model also considers the complex relationship between papers, overcoming the limitations of other ranking systems that rely only on the traditional PageRank algorithm. To produce a more accurate ranking system, our suggested model excludes authors’ self-citation and collaboration citations, which are often used by authors to increase their citation count. To evaluate the RBSD model, four real-world datasets were used: ACM, MAG, DBLP, and Scopus Elsevier, for publication venue information. The proposed model was applied to 2,092,356 papers, with 8,024,869 citations. This was implemented using Apache Spark Graphx to accelerate the execution time for graph analysis and to explore the nature of scholarly data. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperformed the Google Scholar Ranking procedure based citation count and returns reasonable results. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {Anthrax is still endemic in some areas around the world, and a large number of people and livestock are at risk of contracting anthrax. As the pathogenic substance of Bacillus anthracis, anthrax toxin plays an essential pathogenic role. Researchers have conducted detailed studies and reports on their genes, structures, and biological activities. However, few articles analyse the field from the perspective of bibliometrics. In the present study, we used bibliometric software such as Citespace to examine the literature data and aimed to provide a reference for researchers in this field. In terms of journals, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, INFECT IMMUN and J BIOL CHEM rank among the top 10 as to the number of published articles and the number of co-citations, and they have an important influence in the field of anthrax toxins. As for researchers, the quantity and quality of the articles published by the three researchers, LEPPLA SH, MOAYERI M, and COLLIER RJ, have advantages. Their research on anthrax toxin is worthy of attention. On the frontiers of research, future research may have various directions, such as the in-depth explanation of the mechanism of anthrax toxin-induced diseases, how to use anthrax toxin to enhance anti-tumour methods to guide the development of new vaccines based on the immunological mechanism of anthrax toxin, and use new materials and technologies to detect different aspects of development of anthrax toxins, etc. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In today's digital world the information surges with the widespread use of the internet and global communication systems. Healthcare systems are also facing digital transformations with the enhancement in the utilization of healthcare information systems, electronic records in medical, wearable, smart devices, handheld devices, and so on. A bulk of data is produced from these digital transformations. The recent increase in medical big data and the development of computational techniques in the field of cardiology enables researchers and practitioners to extract and visualize medical big data in a new spectrum. The role of medical big data in cardiology becomes a challenging task. Early decision making in cardiac healthcare system has massive potential for dropping the cost of care, refining quality of care, and reducing waste and error. Therefore, to facilitate this process a detailed report of the existing literature will be feasible to help the doctors and practitioners in decision making for the purpose of identifying and treating cardiac diseases. This detailed study will summarize results from the existing literature on big data in the field cardiac disease. This research uses the systematic literature protocol as presented by Kitchenham et al. The data was collected from the published materials from 2008 to 2018 as conference or journal publications, books, magazines and other online sources. 190 papers were included relying on the defined inclusion, exclusion, and checking the quality criteria. The current study helped to identify medical big data features, the application of medical big data, and the analytics of the big data in cardiology. The results of the proposed research shows that several studies exist that are associated to medical big data specifically to cardiology. This research summarizes and organizes the existing literature based on the defined keywords and research questions. The analysis will help doctors to make more authentic decisions, which ultimately will help to use the study as evidence for treating patients with heart related diseases. © 2013 IEEE.},

Further, it opens avenues for practice, which together with research requires adaptation in teaching curricula if policy education were to remain relevant. However, it is not clear to what extent this opportunity is being realized in public policy research and teaching. In this study, we examine the prevalence of big data analytics in public policy research and pedagogy using bibliometric analysis and topic modeling for the former, and content analysis of course titles and descriptions for the latter. We find that despite significant scope for application of various big data techniques, the use of these analytic techniques in public policy has been largely limited to select institutions in a few countries. Further, data science has received limited attention in policy pedagogy, once again with significant geographic variation in its prevalence. We conclude that, to stay relevant, the policy sciences need to pay more attention to the integration of big data techniques in policy research, pedagogy, and thereby practice. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Globally, the forest plays a crucial role in balancing the ecology and vital natural resource to all beings. However, climate change is making natural resource management hard to manage. Rapid development in many areas due to rising population also further challenges resource management throughout the supply chain. Hence, the significance of big data management in the forestry sector is becoming more crucial. It commences from the biophysical and biochemical aspects of the trees, growth and health, transportation, mill industry, product development and the chain also count the utilization and benefits of the forest products to the community. Many studies showed that the application of big data in a proper way could develop its country economically, socially and at the same time, mitigate environmental impacts. The purpose of this paper is to review the application of big data analytics in the forestry sector based on a bibliometric review from 2010 to 2020. The paper first analysed the publications on big data analytics in various activities throughout the supply chain of the forestry sector, based on the works of literature from the Mendeley and Scopus database. The results showed 37% of the publications explained the big data analytics in the upstream activities, 9% in the midstream, 48% in the downstream activities, and 6% throughout the supply chain. It demonstrates a gap in the practices and innovation on big data analytics in the forestry sector supply chain. There is a tremendous opportunity in the application and technology of big data analytics in many of the supply chain operations that could further enhance the potential of the forestry sector in the future. This review is beneficial to the forestry sector in identifying the gap to accelerate the industrial revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) applications throughout the supply chain and serves as a baseline of the current scientific knowledge in the field of big data analytics in the forestry sector. © 2021 Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia.

	abstract = {The purpose of our systematic review was to inspect the recently published research on Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) and harmonize the assimilations it articulates on remote big data management tools, sensing and computing technologies, and visual perception and environment mapping algorithms. The research problems were whether robotic manufacturing processes and industrial wireless sensor networks shape IoRT and lead to improved product quality by use of remote big data management tools, whether IoRT devices communicate autonomously regarding event modeling and forecasting by leveraging machine learning and clustering algorithms, sensing and computing technologies, and image processing tools, and whether smart connected objects, situational awareness algorithms, and edge computing technologies configure IoRT systems and cloud robotics in relation to distributed task coordination through visual perception and environment mapping algorithms. A Shiny app was harnessed for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to configure the flow diagram integrating evidence-based gathered and processed data (the search outcomes and screening procedures). A quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases was carried out throughout June and October 2022, with search terms including “Internet of Robotic Things” + “remote big data management tools”, “sensing and computing technologies”, and “visual perception and environment mapping algorithms”. Artificial intelligence and intelligent workflows by use of AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews), Dedoose, DistillerSR, and SRDR (Systematic Review Data Repository) have been deployed as data extraction tools for literature collection, screening, and evaluation, for document flow monitoring, for inspecting qualitative and mixed methods research, and for establishing robust outcomes and correlations. For bibliometric mapping by use of data visualization, Dimensions AI was leveraged and with regards to layout algorithms, VOSviewer was harnessed. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cross-border cooperation in big data, Internet technology, and e-commerce plays an important role in guiding the people-oriented development of technology applications. In order to provide the latest research fronts of e-commerce development in the new era, this study used the VOSviewer to systematically review the development status of e-commerce supported by big data and Internet technology on the basis of mapping 265 kinds of literature retrieved from The Web of Science database from 1989 to 2020. This paper produces a concise research cluster map based on the co-occurrence network of key phrase data. The clusters cover keyword overview, major countries, organizations, top-level sources, co-citation networks, and bibliographical coupling networks. The analysis of the key phrases map shows that there is still a big gap in the research of e-commerce. With the progress and popularization of the Internet, the public has become more and more interested in electronic transactions, and e-commerce has become more popular. The research on country and organization cluster shows that, with China, the United States, and the United Kingdom as the typical examples, countries with dominant data resources have a greater influence on the organization cluster and source cluster, and are more closely related to each other. To source coupled-cluster analysis and bibliography from a total of two aspects has carried on the more in-depth research, studies have shown that e-commerce topics focused on production and economic research subject, "international journal of production research", "the mis quarterly" and "sustainability Basel " are thought to be the highest rate in publications, in e-commerce and the network technology research field, the "sustainability" is the dominant top journals. At the same time, publications with high co-citation rates have a high degree of bibliographic coupling. © 2022 Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research. All rights reserved.},

As opposed to the ‘black box’ vision, we conceive innovation as a process that emerges from formal and informal R&D efforts. Based on search results on academic publishing, we built a corpus of 13,132 contributions, published between 1970 and 2018. A bibliographic-coupling analysis was then performed, which allowed us to detect eight thematic communities: i) Collaborative innovation, ii) Business model, iii) Knowledge management, iv) Innovation capabilities, v) Firm performance, vi) Networks of innovators, vii) R&D studies, and viii) Eco-innovation. Each of them is subsequently analyzed with text mining and tested using term-based clustering. Our analysis reveals the existence of multiple and heterogeneous dimensions of the IFL that are partially addressed by the literature. Findings open up new questions about the content of the communities and the existence of bridges between them. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Healthcare informatics and analytics (HCI&A), also known as healthcare information technology (HIT), healthcare IS (HIS), and so on, has rapidly evolved with the emerge of advanced data analytics technologies applied to the medical domain. Currently, HCI&A has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners and academic researchers. Accordingly, this emerging field has prompted for an inquiry of the opportunities and challenges related to management of healthcare data, and the application of advanced data analytics to the contemporary healthcare industry. In order to contribute to the literature of healthcare informatics and analytics, this study proposes an HCI&A framework under the context of big data, which covers four important segments such as the underlying technologies, system applications, system evaluations, and emerging research areas. Based on the key features and capabilities of underpinning technologies, the evolution of HCI&A are conceptualized by three stages, namely HCI&A 1.0, HCI&A 2.0, and HCI&A 3.0. By analyzing the technological growth and current research trends, this study outlines the trend map of HCI&A for education and knowledge transfer. We also contributed to conduct a bibliographic study on healthcare informatics and healthcare information systems. To the best of our knowledge, our study is among the very few comprehensive bibliographic studies about HCI&A. We hope that our study can contribute to supplement contemporary thoughts on HCI&A research, and facilitate the related knowledge transfer to the healthcare industry. © 2020},

This study proposes a bibliometric data-driven analysis from the literature to illustrate a clear overall concept of SSCF that reveals hidden indicators for further improvement. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid quantitative and qualitative approach combining data-driven analysis, fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), entropy weight method (EWM) and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is employed to address the uncertainty in the context. Findings: The results show that blockchain, cash flow shortage, reverse factoring, risk assessment and triple bottom line (TBL) play significant roles in SSCF. A comparison of the challenges and gaps among different geographic regions is provided in both advanced local perspective and a global state-of-the-art assessment. There are 35 countries/territories being categorized into five geographic regions. Of the five regions, two, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa, show the needs for more improvement, exclusively in collaboration strategies and financial crisis. Exogenous impacts of wars, natural disasters and disease epidemics are implied as inevitable attributes for enhancing the sustainability. Originality/value: This study contributes to (1) boundary SSCF foundations by data driven, (2) identifying the critical SSCF indicators and providing the knowledge gaps and directions as references for further examination and (3) addressing the gaps and challenges in different geographic regions to provide advanced assessment from local viewpoint and to diagnose the comprehensive global state of the art of SSCF. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Big data and analytics (BDA) are gaining momentum, particularly in the practitioner world. Research linking BDA to improved organizational performance seems scarce and widely dispersed though, with the majority focused on specific domains and/or macro-level relationships. In order to synthesize past research and advance knowledge of the potential organizational value of BDA, the authors obtained a data set of 327 primary studies and 1252 secondary cited papers. This paper reviews this body of research, using three bibliometric methods. First, it elucidates its intellectual foundations via co-citation analysis. Second, it visualizes the historical evolution of BDA and performance research and its substreams through algorithmic historiography. Third, it provides insights into the field's potential evolution via bibliographic coupling. The results reveal that the academic attention for the BDA–performance link has been increasing rapidly. The study uncovered ten research clusters that form the field's foundation. While research seems to have evolved following two main, isolated streams, the past decade has witnessed more cross-disciplinary collaborations. Moreover, the study identified several research topics undergoing focused development, including financial and customer risk management, text mining and evolutionary algorithms. The review concludes with a discussion of the implications for different functional management domains and the gaps for both research and practice. © 2019 British Academy of Management},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing amount of discussion on the use of big data to prevent and treat pandemics. The current research aimed to use CiteSpace (CS) visual analysis to uncover research and development trends, to help academics decide on future research and to create a framework for enterprises and organizations in order to plan for the growth of big data-based epidemic control. First, a total of 202 original papers were retrieved from Web of Science (WOS) using a complete list and analyzed using CS scientometric software. The CS parameters included the date range (from 2011 to 2022, a 1-year slice for co-authorship as well as for the co-accordance assessment), visualization (to show the fully integrated networks), specific selection criteria (the top 20 percent), node form (author, institution, region, reference cited, referred author, journal, and keywords), and pruning (pathfinder, slicing network). Lastly, the correlation of data was explored and the findings of the visualization analysis of big data pandemic control research were presented. According to the findings, “COVID-19 infection” was the hottest cluster with 31 references in 2020, while “Internet of things (IoT) platform and unified health algorithm” was the emerging research topic with 15 citations. “Influenza, internet, China, human mobility, and province” were the emerging keywords in the year 2021–2022 with strength of 1.61 to 1.2. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the top institution, which collaborated with 15 other organizations. Qadri and Wilson were the top authors in this field. The Lancet journal accepted the most papers in this field, while the United States, China, and Europe accounted for the bulk of articles in this research. The research showed how big data may help us to better understand and control pandemics. © 2023 by the authors.},

Yet, existing reviews remain limited due to the piecemeal insights offered through a sub-set rather than the entire corpus of sustainable finance. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a large-scale review that would provide a state-of-the-art overview of the performance and intellectual structure of sustainable finance. To do so, this study engages in a review of sustainable finance research using big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research. In doing so, this study unpacks the most influential articles and top contributing journals, authors, institutions, and countries, as well as the methodological choices and research contexts for sustainable finance research. In addition, this study reveals insights into seven major themes of sustainable finance research, namely socially responsible investing, climate financing, green financing, impact investing, carbon financing, energy financing, and governance of sustainable financing and investing. To drive the field forward, this study proposes several suggestions for future sustainable finance research, which include developing and diffusing innovative sustainable financing instruments, magnifying and managing the profitability and returns of sustainable financing, making sustainable finance more sustainable, devising and unifying policies and frameworks for sustainable finance, tackling greenwashing of corporate sustainability reporting in sustainable finance, shining behavioral finance on sustainable finance, and leveraging the power of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and machine learning for sustainable finance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

First, we identify seven major application areas and six groups of important enabling technologies for Big Data applications and systems. Then, using bibliometrics and an extensive literature review of more than 80 papers, we identify the most important research trends in these areas. In addition, our bibliometric analysis also includes trends in different geographical regions. Our results indicate that manufacturing and agriculture or forestry are the two application areas with the fastest growth. Furthermore, our bibliometric study shows that deep learning and edge or fog computing are the enabling technologies increasing the most.

Results: Our findings show a tremendous increase in published papers after 2014. Most of them are relevant to neurology and medical oncology. The stakeholders are clinicians, researchers, patients, administrators, IT specialists, vendors and policymakers. New BDA tools in medicine are mostly developed for disease monitoring purposes while they utilise visualisation to identify disease patterns and statistical analysis of past data for making predictions. Conclusions: Health analytics provide a unique opportunity for advancing health information research and medical decision making. It provides health information professionals with new tools in problem-solving offering new perspectives in prognosis and diagnosis of diseases. © 2019 Health Libraries Group},

	abstract = {The use of big data and data analytics are slowly emerging in public policy-making, and there are calls for systematic reviews and research agendas focusing on the impacts that big data and analytics have on policy processes. This paper examines the nascent field of big data and data analytics in public policy by reviewing the literature with bibliometric and qualitative analyses. The study encompassed scientific publications gathered from SCOPUS (N = 538). Nine bibliographically coupled clusters were identified, with the three largest clusters being big data's impact on the policy cycle, data-based decision-making, and productivity. Through the qualitative coding of the literature, our study highlights the core of the discussions and proposes a research agenda for further studies. © 2021 The Authors.
